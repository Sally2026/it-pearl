    <h2> The Heart of New York City</h2>

    <p> Central Park is an urban park in New York City, located between the Upper West and Upper East Sides of Manhattan. Covering 843 acres (341 ha), it is the city’s fifth-largest park by area and the most visited urban park in the United States, attracting an estimated 42 million visitors annually. It is also the most filmed location in the world, serving as a backdrop for countless movies and television shows. </p>

    <p> As New York City’s backyard, Central Park offers a green oasis in the heart of the metropolis. The Central Park Conservancy, entrusted by the City of New York, oversees the Park’s complete day-to-day care. For over 40 years, the Conservancy has maintained the Park’s landscapes, trees, and architecture while ensuring cleanliness, visitor services, and long-term sustainability. Through dedicated expertise and stewardship, Central Park remains a place of beauty, recreation, and community for all. </p>

    <h3>A Legacy of Stewardship and Support </h3>

    <p>The Central Park Conservancy is primarily funded by individual donations, raising and investing nearly $100 million annually to preserve and enhance this world-class greenspace. This partnership not only ensures the Park’s longevity but also allows the NYC Department of Parks and Recreation to allocate resources to other parks across the city. The Conservancy’s work generates over $1 billion in annual economic activity and supports 5,000 local jobs. By prioritizing accessibility, sustainability, and public enjoyment, the Conservancy continues to safeguard the Park’s role as a vital resource for New Yorkers and visitors alike. <a href="https://www.centralparknyc.org/leadership" target="_blank"> Learn more </a></p>
